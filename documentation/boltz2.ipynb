    "1. **Introduction to Botlz-2**: Overview of the Botlz-2 and its applications.\n",
    "2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up a local development environment using Docker.\n",

    "## Introduction to Botlz-2 and the Protein-Folding Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting a protein’s three-dimensional shape from its amino acid sequence has been a “grand challenge” in biology for over half a century. In 1973, Christian Anfinsen demonstrated that the information for folding is encoded in the sequence itself when his chemically denatured ribonuclease spontaneously refolded into its active conformation upon removal of denaturants ([Aklectures][1]). This foundational experiment launched an era of **physics-based** and **statistical** modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1994, the biannual **CASP** (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) competition was created to objectively benchmark methods—even before structures were publicly released ([Wikipedia][2]). Early efforts like **Rosetta** (first in FORTRAN, then C++) applied fragment assembly and Monte Carlo sampling for **de novo** prediction, winning CASP tasks via clever energy functions and design protocols ([docs.rosettacommons.org][3], [PMC][4]). Over the 2000s, Rosetta expanded into docking, design, and community-driven platforms like Foldit ([Wikipedia][5]).\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep-learning era arrived in 2020 when **DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2** achieved atomic-level accuracy in CASP14, effectively solving the prediction problem for most single-chain proteins ([Nature][6], [WIRED][7]). Soon after, the Baker lab released **RoseTTAFold**, democratizing high-accuracy predictions on consumer GPUs in minutes ([Baker Lab][8]). In 2024, the Nobel Prize for Chemistry recognized Demis Hassabis, John Jumper, and David Baker for these complementary breakthroughs in AI-driven folding and design ([Le Monde.fr][9]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this lineage, **Botlz-2** leverages a novel **Boltzmann-inspired** architecture that blends state-space models with graph-based potentials to predict structures faster and with fewer resources. This notebook shows you how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Containerize** Botlz-2 in Docker for reproducible local experiments\n",
    "2. **Scale** training and inference via cloud deployment\n",
    "3. **Integrate** with existing folding pipelines and compare performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you’re an academic exploring protein design or an industry practitioner deploying at scale, Botlz-2 offers a lightweight, production-ready alternative in the post-AlphaFold landscape.\n",

    "## Building and Running the Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and run the Docker container for Botlz-2, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Botlz-2 repository to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/gabenavarro/MLContainerLab.git\n",
    "cd MLContainerLab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the provided Dockerfile to build the Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# You can choose any tag you want for the image\n",
    "# Feel free to play around with the base image, just make sure the host has the same or higher CUDA version\n",
    "docker build -f ./assets/build/Dockerfile.boltz2.cu126cp310 -t boltz2:126-310 .\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Run the Docker Container**: Run the Docker container with the necessary configurations. In the first example, we will run the container locally with GPU support. This is the recommended way to run a container while in development mode. For scaling up, we will use the second example which runs the container in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run the container with GPU support\n",
    "docker run -dt \\\n",
    "   --gpus all \\\n",
    "   --shm-size=64g \\\n",
    "   -v \"$(pwd):/workspace\" \\\n",
    "   --name boltz2 \\\n",
    "   --env NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \\\n",
    "   --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/workspace/assets/secrets/gcp-key.json \\\n",
    "   boltz2:126-310\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Note: The `-v \"$(pwd):/workspace\"` option mounts the current directory to `/workspace` in the container, allowing you to access your local files from within the container. The `--env` options set environment variables for GPU visibility and Google Cloud credentials.<br>\n",
    "> Note: The `--gpus all` option allows the container to use all available GPUs. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access the Container with IDE**: In this example, we will use Visual Studio Code to access the container. You can use any IDE of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In a scriptable manner\n",
    "CONTAINER_NAME=boltz2\n",
    "FOLDER=/workspace\n",
    "HEX_CONFIG=$(printf {\\\"containerName\\\":\\\"/$CONTAINER_NAME\\\"} | od -A n -t x1 | tr -d '[\\n\\t ]')\n",
    "code --folder-uri \"vscode-remote://attached-container+$HEX_CONFIG$FOLDER\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The `code` command is used to open Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have the Remote - Containers extension installed in VS Code to access the container directly. <br>\n",

    "## 🧪 Using Botlz-2 for Protein–Protein Interaction Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we demonstrate how to use **Botlz-2**, a Boltzmann-inspired diffusion model, to **replicate a known protein–protein complex**. We'll focus on configuring a `YAML` file to predict the structure of the **BCL2–BAX interaction**, a biologically critical complex involved in **apoptotic signaling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 What Are We Predicting?\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to replicate the structure of **PDB ID: [2XA0](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2XA0)**, which captures the crystal structure of the anti-apoptotic protein **BCL2** in complex with the **BH3 domain of BAX**—a pro-apoptotic partner that binds at a conserved groove on BCL2. This interaction is a well-studied **orthosteric protein–protein interface** that has been targeted by small molecules like **Venetoclax** for cancer therapy ([Souers et al., 2013, *Nat Med*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23291630/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧾 YAML-Driven Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Botlz-2 jobs are driven by declarative `YAML` files. These configuration files define the input PDBs or FASTA sequences, optional MSA sources, recycling steps (analogous to AlphaFold2), and diffusion sampling parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we’ll run Botlz-2 using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "boltz predict /workspace/assets/test-files/boltz2-example.yaml \\\n",
    "    --recycling_steps 10 \\\n",
    "    --diffusion_samples 25 \\\n",
    "    --accelerator gpu \\\n",
    "    --out_dir /workspace/datasets/boltz2/predict2 \\\n",
    "    --cache /workspace/datasets/boltz2/cache \\\n",
    "    --use_msa_server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ What Each Parameter Means\n",
    "\n",
    "* `--recycling_steps 10`: Like AlphaFold, Botlz-2 can iteratively refine its prediction. More recycling may improve local geometry at interfaces.\n",
    "* `--diffusion_samples 25`: Number of denoising trajectories to run; more samples can yield diverse conformations.\n",
    "* `--accelerator gpu`: Enables GPU acceleration (recommended).\n",
    "* `--out_dir`: Path to write final predicted PDB structures.\n",
    "* `--cache`: Stores intermediate MSA and feature computations.\n",
    "* `--use_msa_server`: Queries a remote MSA server instead of relying on precomputed alignments.\n",

    "### 💡 What's Next? Binding-Site–Conditioned Ligand Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve predicted the bound complex, we can **extract the orthosteric binding groove** from BCL2 and pass it as a conditioned 3D input to **DrugFlow**—our diffusion-based generative model for small molecule design.\n",
    "\n",
