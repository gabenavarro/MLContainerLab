    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This documentation provides a guide on Botlz-2 implemented in Python, designed for both local development and cloud deployment using Docker. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to Botlz-2**: Overview of the Botlz-2 and its applications.\n",
    "2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up a local development environment using Docker.\n",
    "3. **Building and Running the Docker Container**: Instructions for building the Docker image and running the container.\n",
    "4. **Deploying to the Cloud**: Guidelines for deploying the Botlz-2 to a cloud platform using Docker.\n",
    "5. **Best Practices**: Tips and best practices for working with Botlz-2 and Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Botlz-2 and the Protein-Folding Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting a protein’s three-dimensional shape from its amino acid sequence has been a “grand challenge” in biology for over half a century. In 1973, Christian Anfinsen demonstrated that the information for folding is encoded in the sequence itself when his chemically denatured ribonuclease spontaneously refolded into its active conformation upon removal of denaturants ([Aklectures][1]). This foundational experiment launched an era of **physics-based** and **statistical** modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1994, the biannual **CASP** (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) competition was created to objectively benchmark methods—even before structures were publicly released ([Wikipedia][2]). Early efforts like **Rosetta** (first in FORTRAN, then C++) applied fragment assembly and Monte Carlo sampling for **de novo** prediction, winning CASP tasks via clever energy functions and design protocols ([docs.rosettacommons.org][3], [PMC][4]). Over the 2000s, Rosetta expanded into docking, design, and community-driven platforms like Foldit ([Wikipedia][5]).\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep-learning era arrived in 2020 when **DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2** achieved atomic-level accuracy in CASP14, effectively solving the prediction problem for most single-chain proteins ([Nature][6], [WIRED][7]). Soon after, the Baker lab released **RoseTTAFold**, democratizing high-accuracy predictions on consumer GPUs in minutes ([Baker Lab][8]). In 2024, the Nobel Prize for Chemistry recognized Demis Hassabis, John Jumper, and David Baker for these complementary breakthroughs in AI-driven folding and design ([Le Monde.fr][9]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this lineage, **Botlz-2** leverages a novel **Boltzmann-inspired** architecture that blends state-space models with graph-based potentials to predict structures faster and with fewer resources. This notebook shows you how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Containerize** Botlz-2 in Docker for reproducible local experiments\n",
    "2. **Scale** training and inference via cloud deployment\n",
    "3. **Integrate** with existing folding pipelines and compare performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you’re an academic exploring protein design or an industry practitioner deploying at scale, Botlz-2 offers a lightweight, production-ready alternative in the post-AlphaFold landscape.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n",
    "- A compatible GPU (for Botlz-2)\n",

    "## Building and Running the Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and run the Docker container for Botlz-2, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Botlz-2 repository to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/gabenavarro/MLContainerLab.git\n",
    "cd MLContainerLab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the provided Dockerfile to build the Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# You can choose any tag you want for the image\n",
    "# Feel free to play around with the base image, just make sure the host has the same or higher CUDA version\n",
    "docker build -f ./assets/build/Dockerfile.boltz2.cu126cp310 -t boltz2:126-310 .\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Run the Docker Container**: Run the Docker container with the necessary configurations. In the first example, we will run the container locally with GPU support. This is the recommended way to run a container while in development mode. For scaling up, we will use the second example which runs the container in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run the container with GPU support\n",
    "docker run -dt \\\n",
    "   --gpus all \\\n",
    "   --shm-size=64g \\\n",
    "   -v \"$(pwd):/workspace\" \\\n",
    "   --name boltz2 \\\n",
    "   --env NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \\\n",
    "   --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/workspace/assets/secrets/gcp-key.json \\\n",
    "   boltz2:126-310\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Note: The `-v \"$(pwd):/workspace\"` option mounts the current directory to `/workspace` in the container, allowing you to access your local files from within the container. The `--env` options set environment variables for GPU visibility and Google Cloud credentials.<br>\n",
    "> Note: The `--gpus all` option allows the container to use all available GPUs. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access the Container with IDE**: In this example, we will use Visual Studio Code to access the container. You can use any IDE of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In a scriptable manner\n",
    "CONTAINER_NAME=boltz2\n",
    "FOLDER=/workspace\n",
    "HEX_CONFIG=$(printf {\\\"containerName\\\":\\\"/$CONTAINER_NAME\\\"} | od -A n -t x1 | tr -d '[\\n\\t ]')\n",
    "code --folder-uri \"vscode-remote://attached-container+$HEX_CONFIG$FOLDER\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The `code` command is used to open Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have the Remote - Containers extension installed in VS Code to access the container directly. <br>\n",
