    "This documentation provides a guide on DrugFlow implemented in Python, designed for both local development and cloud deployment using Docker. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to DrugFlow**: Overview of the DrugFlow and its applications.\n",
    "2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up a local development environment using Docker.\n",
    "3. **Building and Running the Docker Container**: Instructions for building the Docker image and running the container.\n",
    "4. **Deploying to the Cloud**: Guidelines for deploying the DrugFlow to a cloud platform using Docker.\n",
    "5. **Best Practices**: Tips and best practices for working with DrugFlow and Docker.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n",
    "- A compatible GPU (for DrugFlow)\n",
    "- NVIDIA drivers (if using GPU)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Building and Running the Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and run the Docker container for DrugFlow, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the DrugFlow repository to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/gabenavarro/MLContainerLab.git\n",
    "cd MLContainerLab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the provided Dockerfile to build the Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# You can choose any tag you want for the image\n",
    "# Feel free to play around with the base image, just make sure the host has the same or higher CUDA version\n",
    "docker build -f ./assets/build/Dockerfile.drugflow.cu121cp311 -t drugflow:121-311 .\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Run the Docker Container**: Run the Docker container with the necessary configurations. In the first example, we will run the container locally with GPU support. This is the recommended way to run a container while in development mode. For scaling up, we will use the second example which runs the container in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   # Run the container with GPU support\n",
    "   docker run -dt \\\n",
    "      --gpus all \\\n",
    "      --shm-size=64g \\\n",
    "      -v \"$(pwd)/assets:/workspace/assets\" \\\n",
    "      -v \"$(pwd)/documentation:/workspace/documentation\" \\\n",
    "      -v \"$(pwd)/datasets:/workspace/datasets\" \\\n",
    "      --name drugflow \\\n",
    "      --env NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \\\n",
    "      --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/workspace/assets/secrets/gcp-key.json \\\n",
    "      --entrypoint /bin/bash \\\n",
    "      drugflow:121-311\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "> Note: The `-v \"$(pwd):/workspace\"` option mounts the current directory to `/workspace` in the container, allowing you to access your local files from within the container. The `--env` options set environment variables for GPU visibility and Google Cloud credentials.<br>\n",
    "> Note: The `--gpus all` option allows the container to use all available GPUs. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access the Container with IDE**: In this example, we will use Visual Studio Code to access the container. You can use any IDE of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In a scriptable manner\n",
    "CONTAINER_NAME=drugflow\n",
    "FOLDER=/workspace\n",
    "HEX_CONFIG=$(printf {\\\"containerName\\\":\\\"/$CONTAINER_NAME\\\"} | od -A n -t x1 | tr -d '[\\n\\t ]')\n",
    "code --folder-uri \"vscode-remote://attached-container+$HEX_CONFIG$FOLDER\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The `code` command is used to open Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have the Remote - Containers extension installed in VS Code to access the container directly. <br>\n",
    "> Note: Make sure you have installed Remote - Containers extension in VS Code.<br>\n",
