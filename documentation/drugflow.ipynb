    "\n",
    "The search for new medicines has always been a race against time, complexity, and cost. From the chance discovery of **penicillin** in 1928 to today's **AI-generated molecules**, drug discovery has evolved through multiple revolutions—each catalyzed by breakthroughs in biology, chemistry, and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, **generative AI** has emerged not just as a tool for prediction, but as a creative partner—capable of designing novel drug-like molecules tailored to specific protein targets. At the forefront of this revolution is **DrugFlow**, an AI framework that integrates **diffusion models** with protein structural data to unlock inverse drug design at unprecedented scale and precision.\n",

    "| **1900s–1970s** | **Serendipity & Pharmacognosy**                 | Drugs like aspirin, morphine, and penicillin were discovered empirically from natural sources. SAR (Structure–Activity Relationship) understanding was minimal. |\n",

    "### 🔬 The Rise of Generative Models in Drug Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models have transformed molecular discovery from a **screening problem** into an **inverse design challenge**: instead of searching a vast database, we train models to propose molecules that already fit our criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Early Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SMILES-based RNNs / VAEs**: Modeled molecules as text strings. While effective, they often generated invalid molecules or ones lacking novelty.\n",
    "* **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Treated molecules as graphs, capturing chemical connectivity. JT-VAE and GraphAF offered better scaffold control and validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diffusion Models: The Game Changer\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion models—originally developed for image synthesis (e.g., **DDPM**) and later adapted to protein backbone generation (e.g., **RFdiffusion**)—have recently demonstrated **state-of-the-art performance in molecule generation**. They iteratively \"denoise\" random noise into structured, valid molecules while conditioning on protein features, enabling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Precise scaffold placement\n",
    "* Flexible ligand generation\n",
    "* Incorporation of 3D geometric and spatial constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 What is DrugFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "**DrugFlow** is an open, modular AI framework for **structure-conditioned molecular generation** using **diffusion-based generative modeling**. It is built for rapid prototyping, scalable training, and cloud-ready deployment. Designed for computational chemists, bioinformaticians, and ML researchers alike, DrugFlow provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🧠 **Generative Backbones**: Includes graph- and coordinate-based diffusion models\n",
    "* 🧬 **Protein Context Conditioning**: Accepts 3D binding pockets, AlphaFold2 outputs, or sequence embeddings\n",
    "* ⚙️ **Training & Inference Pipelines**: Supports mixed-precision training, checkpointing, and evaluation\n",
    "* ☁️ **Cloud Scalability**: Dockerized environments for seamless transition from local dev to GPU clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why DrugFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical docking or virtual screening, which evaluate billions of compounds **after** generation, DrugFlow focuses on **generating the right molecules** in the first place—guided by structure, logic, and AI-learned priors. Whether you're targeting kinases, GPCRs, or designing novel scaffolds, DrugFlow empowers you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Design rather than search**\n",
    "* **Learn from structure, not just data**\n",
    "* **Scale effortlessly from laptop to cloud**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we’ll guide you through setting up DrugFlow with Docker, running sample tasks on targets like **GSK3-β**, and extending the system to your own proteins or datasets.\n",

    "- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n",
    "- A compatible GPU (for DrugFlow)\n",

    "## Building and Running the Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and run the Docker container for DrugFlow, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the DrugFlow repository to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/gabenavarro/MLContainerLab.git\n",
    "cd MLContainerLab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the provided Dockerfile to build the Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# You can choose any tag you want for the image\n",
    "# Feel free to play around with the base image, just make sure the host has the same or higher CUDA version\n",
    "docker build -f ./assets/build/Dockerfile.drugflow.cu121cp311 -t drugflow:121-311 .\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Run the Docker Container**: Run the Docker container with the necessary configurations. In the first example, we will run the container locally with GPU support. This is the recommended way to run a container while in development mode. For scaling up, we will use the second example which runs the container in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run the container with GPU support\n",
    "docker run -dt \\\n",
    "   --gpus all \\\n",
    "   --shm-size=64g \\\n",
    "   -v \"$(pwd)/assets:/workspace/assets\" \\\n",
    "   -v \"$(pwd)/documentation:/workspace/documentation\" \\\n",
    "   -v \"$(pwd)/datasets:/workspace/datasets\" \\\n",
    "   --name drugflow \\\n",
    "   --env NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \\\n",
    "   --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/workspace/assets/secrets/gcp-key.json \\\n",
    "   --entrypoint /bin/bash \\\n",
    "   drugflow:121-311\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Note: The `-v \"$(pwd):/workspace\"` option mounts the current directory to `/workspace` in the container, allowing you to access your local files from within the container. The `--env` options set environment variables for GPU visibility and Google Cloud credentials.<br>\n",
    "> Note: The `--gpus all` option allows the container to use all available GPUs. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access the Container with IDE**: In this example, we will use Visual Studio Code to access the container. You can use any IDE of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In a scriptable manner\n",
    "CONTAINER_NAME=drugflow\n",
    "FOLDER=/workspace\n",
    "HEX_CONFIG=$(printf {\\\"containerName\\\":\\\"/$CONTAINER_NAME\\\"} | od -A n -t x1 | tr -d '[\\n\\t ]')\n",
    "code --folder-uri \"vscode-remote://attached-container+$HEX_CONFIG$FOLDER\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The `code` command is used to open Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have the Remote - Containers extension installed in VS Code to access the container directly. <br>\n",
    "> Note: Make sure you have installed Remote - Containers extension in VS Code.<br>\n"
