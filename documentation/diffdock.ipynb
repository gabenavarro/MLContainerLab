    "# DiffDock with Docker for Local Development and Cloud Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation provides a guide on DiffDock implemented in Python, designed for both local development and cloud deployment using Docker. It covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to DiffDock**: Overview of the DiffDock and its applications.\n",
    "2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up a local development environment using Docker.\n",
    "3. **Building and Running the Docker Container**: Instructions for building the Docker image and running the container.\n",
    "4. **Deploying to the Cloud**: Guidelines for deploying the DiffDock to a cloud platform using Docker.\n",
    "5. **Best Practices**: Tips and best practices for working with DiffDock and Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to DiffDock and the Protein-Folding Journey\n",

    "Biology’s grand challenge has long been predicting how a linear chain of amino acids folds into its unique three-dimensional structure—a concept first crystallized by Christian Anfinsen’s thermodynamic hypothesis in the 1950s, which asserted that a protein’s sequence alone determines its native conformation ([profiles.nlm.nih.gov][1])([Wikipedia][2]).  In the decades that followed, experimental methods like X-ray crystallography and NMR dominated structural biology, but they were laborious and costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1990s, David Baker’s group transformed the field by introducing **Rosetta**, the first large‐scale *in silico* ab initio folding algorithm that combined fragment assembly with energy functions derived from physics and statistics ([HHMI][3])([docs.rosettacommons.org][4]).  Rosetta’s success in CASP (the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) competitions demonstrated that computational models could rival, and eventually guide, experimental structure determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new era dawned in 2020 when DeepMind’s **AlphaFold2** achieved atomic-level accuracy across CASP14 targets, reporting a median Cα RMSD of 0.96 Å—an order‐of‐magnitude leap over prior methods ([Nature][5])([Google DeepMind][6]).  Almost in tandem, the Baker lab released **RoseTTAFold**, an efficient three-track network that further democratized high-accuracy predictions ([Baker Lab][7])([Science][8]).  Meta’s **ESMFold** soon followed, leveraging large protein language models to predict structures at unprecedented scale ([Science][9])([Meta AI][10]).\n",
    "\n",
    "While these advances excel at *predicting* known sequences, designing entirely new proteins demands **generative** approaches.  Inspired by successes in image and language generation, the Baker lab recently introduced **RFdiffusion**, which fine-tunes a RoseTTAFold network to act as a denoising diffusion model over backbone coordinates ([Nature][11])([Protein Design Institute][12]).  RFdiffusion can scaffold enzyme active sites, assemble symmetric oligomers, and create novel binding proteins with orders-of-magnitude fewer experimental tests required ([Baker Lab][13])([Baker Lab][14]).\n",

    "- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n",
    "- A compatible GPU (for DiffDock)\n",

    "## Building and Running the Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and run the Docker container for DiffDock, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the DiffDock repository to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/gabenavarro/MLContainerLab.git\n",
    "cd MLContainerLab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the provided Dockerfile to build the Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# You can choose any tag you want for the image\n",
    "# Feel free to play around with the base image, just make sure the host has the same or higher CUDA version\n",
    "docker build -f ./assets/build/Dockerfile.diffdock.cu117cp310 -t diffdock:117-310 .\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Run the Docker Container**: Run the Docker container with the necessary configurations. In the first example, we will run the container locally with GPU support. This is the recommended way to run a container while in development mode. For scaling up, we will use the second example which runs the container in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   # Run the container with GPU support\n",
    "   docker run -dt \\\n",
    "      --gpus all \\\n",
    "      --shm-size=64g \\\n",
    "      -v \"$(pwd):/workspace\" \\\n",
    "      --name diffdock \\\n",
    "      --env NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \\\n",
    "      --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/workspace/assets/secrets/gcp-key.json \\\n",
    "      diffdock:126-310\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "> Note: The `-v \"$(pwd):/workspace\"` option mounts the current directory to `/workspace` in the container, allowing you to access your local files from within the container. The `--env` options set environment variables for GPU visibility and Google Cloud credentials.<br>\n",
    "> Note: The `--gpus all` option allows the container to use all available GPUs. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access the Container with IDE**: In this example, we will use Visual Studio Code to access the container. You can use any IDE of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In a scriptable manner\n",
    "CONTAINER_NAME=diffdock\n",
    "FOLDER=/workspace\n",
    "HEX_CONFIG=$(printf {\\\"containerName\\\":\\\"/$CONTAINER_NAME\\\"} | od -A n -t x1 | tr -d '[\\n\\t ]')\n",
    "code --folder-uri \"vscode-remote://attached-container+$HEX_CONFIG$FOLDER\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The `code` command is used to open Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have the Remote - Containers extension installed in VS Code to access the container directly. <br>\n",
    "> Note: Make sure you have installed Remote - Containers extension in VS Code.<br>\n",
